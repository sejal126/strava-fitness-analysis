# Fitabase Data Cleaning Report

## 1. Overview
This report details the SQL data cleaning process performed on the Fitabase database, ensuring data integrity and reliability for analysis.

## 2. Data Cleaning Process

### 2.1 Data Validation Rules
1. Removed records with negative values for:
   - Steps
   - Distance
   - Calories
   - Activity Minutes
   - Weight
   - BMI
   - Heart Rate

2. Heart rate values limited to 0-200 BPM

### 2.2 Duplicate Record Handling
- Removed duplicates from all tables:
  - daily_activity
  - daily_intensities
  - daily_steps
  - weight_log
  - minute_steps
  - heart_rate
- Kept the earliest record for each unique combination of ID and timestamp

### 2.3 Index Optimization
- Added indexes for better performance:
  - ActivityDate (daily_activity)
  - ActivityDay (daily_intensities)
  - ActivityDay (daily_steps)
  - Date (weight_log)
  - Time (minute_steps)
  - Time (heart_rate)

### 2.4 Data Constraints
- Added CHECK constraints to prevent future invalid data:
  - Steps must be >= 0
  - Activity minutes must be >= 0
  - Step totals must be >= 0
  - Heart rate must be between 0-200 BPM

## 3. Key Insights

### 3.1 Data Quality Issues
1. Multiple tables contained negative values
   - Indicates potential data collection or processing issues
   - Requires further investigation

2. Significant number of duplicates found
   - Likely due to:
     - Multiple data collection attempts
     - Data synchronization issues
     - API integration problems

3. Heart rate anomalies
   - Values exceeding 200 BPM
   - Indicates potential sensor calibration issues

### 3.2 Performance Improvements
1. Enhanced query performance
   - Better data retrieval speed
   - Improved handling of large datasets

2. Prevents future data quality issues
   - Maintains data integrity
   - Reduces need for manual cleaning

## 4. Recommendations

### 4.1 Data Collection
1. Implement client-side validation
   - Add range checks for all numeric values
   - Prevent submission of invalid data

### 4.2 Monitoring
1. Schedule periodic data quality checks
2. Monitor duplicate record creation
3. Track constraint violations

## 5. Technical Details

### 5.1 SQL Implementation
Example queries:
- Removed negative values:
```sql
DELETE FROM daily_activity 
WHERE TotalSteps < 0 
   OR TotalDistance < 0 
   OR Calories < 0;
```

- Removed duplicates:
```sql
DELETE FROM daily_activity 
WHERE rowid NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(rowid) 
    FROM daily_activity 
    GROUP BY Id, ActivityDate
);
```

- Added constraints:
```sql
ALTER TABLE daily_activity 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_steps CHECK (TotalSteps >= 0);
```

### 5.2 Database Structure
Tables cleaned:
- daily_activity
- daily_intensities
- daily_steps
- weight_log
- minute_steps
- heart_rate

## 6. Conclusion
The SQL data cleaning process successfully improved data quality and integrity while implementing measures to prevent future issues. The cleaned data is now ready for analysis and reporting.
