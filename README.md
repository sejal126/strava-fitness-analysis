# strava-fitness-analysis


This project was completed during my internship at **Labmentix** and involves analyzing real-world Fitbit user data to discover insights into daily activity, sleep, and calorie patterns.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset consists of 30-day logs from 30 users, including metrics like:

- Steps taken per day
- Calories burned
- Sleep duration and quality
- Weight logs
- Minute-level activity tracking

The goal was to clean, explore, and visualize this data using multiple tools and techniques to extract actionable insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data cleaning and EDA  
- 🗃️ **SQL (SQLite/MySQL)** – Querying and aggregating data  
- 📊 **Power BI** – Building interactive dashboards and visual reports

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and understand the behavioral patterns of Fitbit users
- Identify correlations between steps, sleep, and calorie burn
- Present insights through queries, notebooks, and dashboards

## 📁 Deliverables

- ✅ `analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with Pandas-based analysis  
- ✅ `analysis.sql` – SQL queries for insights and summaries  
- ✅ `dashboard.pbix` – Power BI dashboard with interactive visuals  
- ✅ `pandas_analysis.pdf` – PDF report summarizing Python analysis  
- ✅ `sql_report.pdf` – PDF report summarizing SQL insights  
- ✅ `powerbi_report.pdf` – PDF of the Power BI dashboard and findings

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Users with higher step counts consistently burned more calories  
- Average sleep duration varied significantly across individuals  
- Most activity spikes occurred in the evening hours

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `analysis.ipynb` for Python analysis  
3. Import CSV files into your own SQL or Power BI environment  
4. Review the PDF reports for summarized findings

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This project helped me gain real-world experience with:
- Data cleaning and manipulation using Pandas
- Writing efficient SQL queries for data aggregation
- Building insightful, shareable dashboards with Power BI
